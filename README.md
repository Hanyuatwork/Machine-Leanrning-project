# Machine-Learning-project

  In this project, I first analyzed the relationship (correlation coefficient) between each of the two features represented by an image with 8 * 8 cells. According to the correlation coefficient, it will determine which feature I will use in order to train and predict the data.
  
 I went over all the method we learned in class, include perceptron, Adaline, Logistic Regression, Kernel, Decision tree, Random Forests and Reinforce learning. By fitting two features (GPD and Health), I discovered that it produced the low accuracy. Therefore, i chose the Kernel method to increase accuracy. (only shows AdaBoost, and SVM with 4 Kernels here)
 
  I separated the data to training and testing groups. The basic idea is to train the computer by go over the data in training group, then attempt to predict rest of data. Afterwards, it can simply compare the predicated data to the testing group to check accuracy.
